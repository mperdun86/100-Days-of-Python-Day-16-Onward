<h1>The Best Movies EVER According to ME!</h1>
<h2>Or at least three that are pretty decent</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
<p>This one is non negotiable. This movie has everything, betrayel, revenge, love, triumph, sorrow, justice, intrigue!
    It follows the story of Edmond Dantes, a simple, good, and innocent man, who is betrayed by many, including his best friend, and
    wrongly sentenced to life a terrible prison, the Château d'If. While in prison, he meets a priest, Abbé Faria, who is a very wise
    man. He educates Edmond, how to read, write, fight, to do math, and to speak multiple languages. Upon his escape from the prison, he locates the priests vast 
    treasure, and returns as "The Count of Monte Cristo". Using the tools taught to him by the priest, he exacts his revenge with surgical precision, no longer the simple, naive man he once was. It is captivating from beginning to end.

<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>
<p>What is a Mad Max movie doing on this list of Best movies? Well, you clearly have not seen it if thats even a question.
    Fury road is exactly what you expect from the franchise and more. It is a not stop action
    feast, that draws you into the dangerous world of post apocalyptic Australia. Max teams
    up with Furiosa, The driver of one of Joe's war-rigs and previous wife, who betrays him to rescue his
    wives and deliver them to the "green place", a mythical land where plants still grow
    and the weater is clean. To get there however, is a brutal and nonstop vehicular battle against Joe's war boys
    and raiders.

<h3>Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</h3>
<P>
    Of the franchise, I think this one is the best of them all. Return of the Jedi is the epic conclusion to a
    the heroic struggle between the rebels and the opressive galactic empire. The rebels launch a daring mission
    to rescue one of their captured allies and prepare for a final battle to stop the Empire’s newest and most 
    dangerous weapon. Along the way, Luke Skywalker faces personal trials that will determine his
    destiny and the fate of the galaxy. The story blends action, adventure, and emotional stakes, bringing long-running
    character arcs to a dramatic and satisfying close. It explores themes of loyalty, redemption, and the enduring 
    fight between good and evil.
